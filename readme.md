# Bootstrap To Material
## Overview
This extension will turn any page made with Bootstrap 4 into one that uses Material Design.

**Disclaimer:** this extension is still in really early development, so I would consider only keeping it enabled while developing, as it may (and it will) cause unexpected behaviors on websites. For example, it prevents scrolling in https://material.io/guidelines/ itself...

## Credits
This extension was made using:
* AngularJS (Angular â‰¤ 1.6.9)
* AngularJS Material
* Material Design Icons

## Changelog
### 0.1.0 (current):
* The extension now _fully_ supports buttons!
* Added a master switch in the settings popup (still nothing in the advanced settings...)
#### Known issues:
* Some attributes of the original button might not be copied on the Material Design one
* For some arcane reason, enabling the extension works well, but you have to click twice on the master checkbox to disable it

### 0.0.2:
* The extension now converts buttons!

### 0.0.1:
* First release
* Added a blank settings page
